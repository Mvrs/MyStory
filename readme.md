## Notes

I decided to hardcode my Project with the UIKit and struggled implementing the UITableView that UIKit provides.
Dealing with constraints and knowing what piece of code has major downsides became difficult to trace. Dealing with Xcode so far
hasn't been great on the DX side of things, but my main concern was debugging the UI Layout; especially coming from React Native.
